    <p>Hey, so you are here! What do you think? Nice site, huh? No? Alright, anyways...</p>
    <p>You might know who I am. Yes, it's me. The guy in your mind right now, that's me 100%.</p>
    <p>I trust that you will recognize me. I guess, how are you? Oh right, this isn't chatting...</p>
    <p>I love you. No, like I mean it. I LOVE YOU. I really don't know how to express this feeling, but make sure to know that this feeling that I am expressing is THE STRONGEST OF ITS KIND. I am not even joking!</p>
    <p>Hey, just in case you don't know who I am, I am the one who sits after you. Haha, get it? Like that day you asked me about if "after" is in front, which is obviously not. What's that, not funny? Alright, I respect that. Anyways...</p>
    <p>Sooo, do you accept my love or not? I am funny, trust me! Also, add me on Insta or Discord (prefer Discord), but both of them work. My Discord is ock2, and my Insta is zaki_exists. Yeah, weird names, I know!! By the way, your voice is so kawaii~ ;~;</p>
